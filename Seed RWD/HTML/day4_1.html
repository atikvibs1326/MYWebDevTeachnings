            round()
            round rounds up to the nearest Integer which can be above or below or even equal to the actual value.
            In the case of a positive number, anything which is equal to or below x.49 will be converted to a lower
            number ie x.00 whereas anything which is equal to or more than x.5 will be converted to a higher number ie
            x+1.00
            In the case of a negative number, anything which is equal to or below -x.5 will be converted to a lower
            number ie -x-1.00 whereas anything which is equal to or more than -x.49 will be converted to a higher number
            ie -x.00
            <br>
            <br>
            floor()
            floor rounds up to the nearest Integer which can be equal to or below the actual value.
            In the case of a positive number, anything between x.01 to x.99 will be converted to a lower number ie x.00
            whereas x.00 will remain the same x.00
            In the case of a negative number, anything between -x.01 to -x.99 will be converted to a lower number ie
            -x-1.00 whereas -x.00 will remain the same -x.00
            <br><br>
            ceil()
            ceil rounds up to the nearest Integer which can be equal to or above the actual value.
            In the case of a positive number, anything between x.01 to x.99 will be converted to an upper number ie
            x+1.00 whereas x.00 will remain the same x.00
            In the case of a negative number, anything between -x.01 to -x.99 will be converted to an upper number ie
            -x.00 whereas -x.00 will remain the same -x.00
