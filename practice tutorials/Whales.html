    <h1>Whales </h1>
    <hr>

    <p>Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. As an informal and
        colloquial grouping, they correspond to large members of the infraorder Cetacea, i.e. all cetaceans apart from
        dolphins and porpoises.</p>
        <hr>
    <p>
       <a href="#nowhere">dolphins</a>  and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla, which consists of even-toed ungulates. Their closest
        non-cetacean living relatives are the hippopotamuses, from which they and other cetaceans diverged about 54
        million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are
        thought to have had their last common ancestor around 34 million years ago. Mysticetes include four extant
        (living) families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right
        whale), and Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale)

    <h2>Blue Whale</h2>
    <p>
        The largest individuals have been estimated at being 150-200 tonnes.
        Blue whales are light grey/blue to dark grey while at the surface, but seen underwater they are a luminous aqua
        blue

    <h2>Humpback Whale</h2>
    <p>
        They are slow swimmers (allows tourist boats - and whalers - to get close). Males at breeding time sing the
        longest and most complex songs in the animal kingdom.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Sperm Whale</h2>
    <p>
        Only males are found in Antarctic waters. Sperm whales are toothed whales rather than filter feeders and are the
        deepest and longest of all whale divers catching giant squid in the dark ocean depths.
