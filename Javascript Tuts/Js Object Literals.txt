Js Object Literals

js object literal is a DataStructure that is used to Store 
Multiple type of data that data is of any type it can be integer,
string,Character,Boolean,Array etc etc

this object literal are unstructured and they do not have any 
order and they can be accessed by the object name
Object Literals are Stored in Key value pair


Syntax

const/let objectname= {variable_name:'Value'}; 
                       ------------  _______
				Key		  Value

Example
const product={name:'Gummy Bears',
               inStock:true,
               price:1.99,
               flavors:['Grape','apple','cherry']
};


Creating the object literals we use the {} brakcets 
const KithenSink={favnum:123,
			isfun:true,
			colors:['red','orange'],
			firstname:'Atik'
}

Accessing the Object literals

to access the Object Literals what we need to do 
is that we access it just like we accesss our array like arr[0]=where arr is the name of the refernce variable and the 0 is the index number
In object literals we do similar things but in the we use thee refernce variable and whatever we want to access we use the "" in that 

like if i want to acces the colors from the Kithensink

Donts:	KithenSink{2}   OR   KithenSink{colors}
O/P		undefined		   undefined
whereas we 

Do's:  KithenSink{"colors "} this will output us like 
O/P	colors['red','orange']

Everything in the object literals 
all keys are converted into the Strings
Except for Symbols


We can also access the data by using the (.) operator 
Like 
	KithenSink.colors
O/P	colors['red','orange']

we can Also modify the values in the Object literals
by intializing it also can add new data and delte as well

Like if i want to add black color into my color Array in the KithenSink Object 
here is howyoudo
Adding new element
	KithenSink.color='black'
O/P 	colors['red','orange','black']
Modifying existing element
	KithenSink.firstname='bravo'
O/P	firstname='bravo'  it will change the value from atik to bravo

delteing the element
	delete kithenSink.firstname
O/P this will delte the firstname from the object KithenSink
